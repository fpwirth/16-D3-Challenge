          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Poverty is mildly correlated with individuals who smoke and lack healthcare based on <a href='https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml'>2014 ACS 1-year estimates</a>.  It is not surprising that those people that lack healthcare also smoke as healthcare providers would likely recommend they stop smoking.  Given those in poverty could receive free or highly subsidized healthcarein the US, one does wonder why they lack healthcare.</p>

          <p>The analysis also indicated that older individuals or poorer individuals are more likely smokers given the mild correlation.  This fact is discouraging as smoking is viewed as detrimental to one's health.  The research into the effects of smoking is relatively young compared to older individual's age allowing them to not understand the effects of smoking at an earlier age.  Poorer people lacking healthcare most likely are not receiving the warning of smoking from healthcare professionals</p>

          <p>Obesity was not as well correlated as other factors to age, income or poverty levels.  However, most states still had approximately a third of those surveyed as being obese.</p>
